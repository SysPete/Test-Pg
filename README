    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS

        use Test::Pg;
        use Test::More;

ATTRIBUTES

    The following attributes can be passed to the constructor.

 auth

    The initdb authentication method. Defaults to 'trust'.

 base_dir

    The directory where the database cluster will be stored. Defaults to a
    temporary directory. See also "tempdir_options".

    Any directory provided as argument will be coerced into a Path::Tiny
    object.

 base_port

    We attempt to use this port first, and will increment from there. The
    final port ends up in the "port" attribute.

 encoding

    Defaults to 'UTF8'.

 initdb

    The path to the initdb executable. If not provided then File::Which is
    used to try and find it.

 locale

    Defaults to 'C'.

 nosync

    By default we pass --nosync option to initdb and -F to "postmaster"
    executable.

    If you wish to disable this behaviour set this attribute to 0 (zero).

 pgdata

    The file system location of the database configuration files.

    Defaults to subdir data of "base_dir".

 postmaster

    The path to the postmaster or postgres executable. If not provided then
    File::Which is used to try and find one of them.

 tempdir_options

    A hash reference of options to be passed to "tempdir" in Path::Tiny
    when the default value of "pgdata" is used (a temporary directory).

    If no options are provided but $ENV{TEST_PG_PRESERVE} is set then
    CLEANUP => 0 will be used to prevent the "pgdata" directory from being
    cleaned up on exit.

 username

    Defaults to 'postgres'.
